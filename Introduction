Heart Disease Prediciton


We used patient’s data to predict ‘Heart Diseases’. 
Dataset was taken from UCI repository and it had 14 columns 
(age, gender, blood pressure, Chest-pain type, Serum Cholesterol,
Fasting Blood Sugar) .
After we cleaned dataset and used ML techniques KNN, Decision tree, 
Random Forest to predict diseases. 
In the end we compare results and get best results.
